# Data types in Python

## Objective

Explain variables and data types in Python
Summarize the use of objects in Python
Create a data structure for your Recipe app

## Reasons for data type choice

I decided to use a dictionary to store all of the recipes. I felt with the information that needed to be provided with the name, cook time and ingredients it worked best. You can pull each recipes items or cook time really easily. I felt this would be the simpliest way of going about it without some work around.
